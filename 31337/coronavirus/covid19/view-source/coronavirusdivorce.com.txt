<p class="has-text-align-center">Introduction</p>



<p>The divorce rate in China has increased significantly because couples spent much time at home quarantined. According to the register offices across the nation, more than 300 individuals are filing for divorce since February 24<sup>th</sup> in Dazhou, Sichuan Province of South Western China (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Jiang, 2020</a>). Officials consider the primary reason for the divorce is the couples spending more time in closed quarantines. The divorce rates in China have increased tremendously during the coronavirus era as compared to the previous times (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Jiang, 2020</a>), so we know that the coronavirus is related to increased divorce rate in China. Also, young quarantined individuals spent much time together, which opens the door for arguments and thus, led to divorce between many couples. According to Web Desk (<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/03/14/Coronavirus-driving-divorce-rates-up-in-China.html">2020</a>), the closure of the register&#8217;s office for three weeks also caused an increase in divorces. The close-down led to the piling up of divorce requests in the office. With the propagation of the virus, the same problem might happen in the U.S due to a high number of quarantined individuals. The impact of coronavirus continues to be correlated with divorces not only in China, but also possibly in the U.S because of various factors such as long quarantined periods. </p>



<p>In China, coronavirus contributes to many social ripples such as divorce, especially among individuals quarantined in their homes. The primary reason for secluding people, particularly the victims, is to avert the spread of the malady, which is causing many deaths in the world (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Jiang, 2020</a>). The virus is correlated with many marriage separations in the Asian country, given that in the last three weeks, the office of the separation attorney in Wuhan received more than 300 divorce applications (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Web Desk, 2020</a>). The most significant number of the divorces are individuals quarantined in their homes, for they complain of various matters &#8212; among them, love lost. For example, Xi&#8217;an, who is one of the registries in Wuhan, received more than 14 separation files, which is a clear indication of how individuals are determined to abandon their marriages despite the devastation of the sickness. Besides, in Wuhan city, where the virus emanated, a limit was placed on individuals’ divorce to 14 per day to regulate marriage breakups in the locality (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Jiang, 2020</a>).  However, people project that the trend is controllable since China is presently registering minimal cases of the spread of the virus.</p>



<p>According to Jiang (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">2020</a>), the prime reason for the separation is too much time the couples spent together in their isolation places. Consequently, the confinement denies some of them their conjugal rights.  For example, Lu Shijuan, who is the marriage counselor in Dazhou Province, explained in one of the interviews how many victims are volunteering to divorce due to the increase in the quarantined periods (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Jiang, 2020</a>). Marriage therapists complain that too much time patients spend isolation is the primary cause of the breakage. Due to the virus, the divorce rate in China is on an upward trend.</p>



<p>Additionally, many people in young marriages spent a lot of time in quarantines, hence engaging in petty arguments, which makes them rush to divorce (<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/03/14/Coronavirus-driving-divorce-rates-up-in-China.html">Web Desk, 2020</a>).<strong> </strong>Furthermore, the lack of marriage counselors among them may be another reason for the increase in splits. Many argue that quarantined persons need to be well-guided on issues concerning love and partnership to save people’s marriages in China. As a result of that, the authorities have deployed marriage advisors to counter the issue. Quarantined couples are denied matrimonial opportunities (such as kissing) because they must wear protective gear such as gloves and masks. For that reason, people criticize the use of protective equipment since they make the victims live in solace.</p>



<p> In China, there is a heated debate of whether spending lengthy times in quarantines in beneficial to the married persons, given that the step is propagating many divorces. Jiang (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">2020</a>) describes how people who spend less time together are less likely to divorce as compared to their counterparts who spend many periods together. The quarantine of couples who already did not get along may also lead to divorces. Jiang (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">2020</a>) suggests how the isolation of married individuals after holidays where they had enjoyed their lives may lead to them divorcing for they are introduced to challenging circumstances, specifically individuals with dreadful viruses such as corona. Many of them even believe that quarantining is a ploy to eliminate their lives because of the isolation. Therefore, that makes them live a fearful and stressful life (<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/03/14/Coronavirus-driving-divorce-rates-up-in-China.html">Web Desk, 2020</a>). Quarantining couples are driving many divorces in China since some couples may be having marital issues &#8212; leading to quarrels that may propagate divorce among them.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, in the U.S, divorces may happen due to the increase in the number of couples quarantined in various isolation centers in the nation. The individuals may consider divorce due to multiple issues, such as spending too much time together in close quarters (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html">Jiang, 2020</a>). Many of them may have been spending less time together due to different problems such as work pressure. Hence, isolating them together may create unwanted ideological differences that may lead to them separating. In the U.S, though, confined units are assigned counseling officers to advise the secluded individuals on various matters such as living in harmony (<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/03/14/Coronavirus-driving-divorce-rates-up-in-China.html">Web Desk, 2020</a>). The step may aid in preventing many divorces in the U.S as compared to China. Also, in the U.S, quarantines may instigate divorce among families since some companies are not paying the isolated persons (<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/03/14/Coronavirus-driving-divorce-rates-up-in-China.html">Web Desk, 2020</a>).</p>



<p>Consequently, that may lead to divorce in families due to the lack of appropriate finances to run the families. Even if President Trump promised firms to pay the quarantined members of society, some companies are yet to honor the command, for they do not see it as financially productive. Consequently, that may end marriages since one member of the family, especially the father, is left to meet the family requirements.</p>



<p>The ongoing quarantines because of the coronavirus pandemic may compel people to file for divorces in different courts due to the fear that the sickness may take one of their family members. The decision may hence put children in a depressed state, given that they lack one of the parents (<a href="https://qz.com/1818731/how-to-deal-with-your-partner-child-parent-in-quarantine/">GoldHill, 2020</a>). Moreover, young isolated couples choose separation because of spending too much time together in their homes. The situation may make them begin pointing fingers at each other, leading to one of the partners filing for a divorce, which may be detrimental to their love lives (<a href="https://qz.com/1818731/how-to-deal-with-your-partner-child-parent-in-quarantine/">GoldHill, 2020</a>). Consequently, it may be applicable for the governments to look for ideal solutions when quarantining couples in their homes to counter family breakages, which may leave the lives of their other family members, particularly children, in jeopardy. Just like China, the U.S should find proper remedies in dealing with issues regarding divorce among the coronavirus couples to reduce the number of single families in society (<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/03/14/Coronavirus-driving-divorce-rates-up-in-China.html">Web Desk, 2020</a>). Like in China, many young individuals in the U.S delayed their divorces as a result of the closure of government offices because of the coronavirus outbreak. In the country, the offices were closed for nearly three weeks, thereby leading to the pile-up of the divorce cases.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Conclusion</p>



<p>Coronavirus continues to be a threat to the social, political, and economic progress of many nations in the world. Nonetheless, so far China is the most affected in terms of the increase in numbers of divorce cases. Take into account that the closure of the divorce attorneys’ offices during the coronavirus outbreak times contributed to the increase in the number of divorce cases. Long-time seclusion of couples in their quarantined homes is the primary cause of separation in China that we are aware of, as of yet. We are watching for how the impact of the coronavirus affects families and divorce rates around the world as the pandemic continues its course.</p>
